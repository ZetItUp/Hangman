# Hangman

## How To play: 
* Clone the repository
* Compile it using VS Code or Visual Studio
* Download the words.txt file and place it in the same directory as the compiled executable.
  This is usually being located in: <project folder>/Hangman/bin/debug/net8.0/Hangman.exe

## Alternative (Your own words list)
* Place a textfile in the same directory as the Executable
* Name the textfile "words.txt"
* Fill it with random words, one word per line, no whitespaces allowed
