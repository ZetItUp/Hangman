# Hangman
This is a Console version of the classic game Hangman written in C#.
The goal is to give some introduction to graphical usage in console applications using C#. 
By going through the code and see how things are done, i hope it can give you ideas of how
to write your own applications with a more "fun" style to them.

## How To play: 
* Clone the repository
* Compile it using VS Code or Visual Studio
* Download the words.txt file and place it in the same directory as the compiled executable.
  
  This is usually being located in: "project folder"/Hangman/bin/debug/net8.0/Hangman.exe

## Alternative (Your own words list)
* Place a textfile in the same directory as the Executable
* Name the textfile "words.txt"
* Fill it with random words, one word per line, no whitespaces allowed


### This is just a little project, do whatever you want with it, no licenses etc.
